  "body": "Well, hello there. You've somehow stumbled upon Inj3ct0r (CIXHacx). If you don't know what it is, it's simple.\r\nIt's a packed code for homebrew on 3DS. This is my second ever project, so cut me some slack if it isn't perfect.\r\nCurrently, it's on version v1.6! A lot of updates have been made since I FIRST released it, and then pulled it. \r\nBut hey, if you wanna support me, Subscribe to my [YouTube Page](https://goo.gl/bTwX0Q).\r\n\r\nIf you don't know how to install this, Look below.\r\n\r\n# INSTALLATION GUIDE\r\n \r\n1. Pull out your 3DS's SD Card, and load it up on a computer.\r\n2. Go to your \"3DS\" Folder on your SD card.\r\n3. Drag the contents of the \"3ds\" folder you downloaded Inj3ct0r, and place them in there.\r\n ",
